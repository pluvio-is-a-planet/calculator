# calculator

This web app is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic
operations. It currently supports addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.

The calculator also keeps a history of the results of previous calculations,
so you can apply additional operations in a sequence. It supports both
button clicks and keyboard shortcuts for the operators and functions.

Keyboard shortcuts for numbers (You can use either the numpad or
the numbers row to enter a number):

 - Addition: use either the '+' key on the numpad or press 'Shift + ='
 - Subtraction: use either the '-' key on the numpad or press 'Shift + -'
 - Multiplication: use either the '*' key on the numpad, press 'Shift + 8'
 (the number row above the letters), or the 'x' key
 - Division: use either '/' key.
